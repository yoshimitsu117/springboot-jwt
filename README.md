# springboot-jwt
Hit the /authenticate with postman to generate token with payload

{
"username":"admin",
"password":"password"
}
and then for each and every request we need to pass Authorization key with value Bearer along with token to authenticate or get response.

We can hit / url to check whether we have proper token or not.
